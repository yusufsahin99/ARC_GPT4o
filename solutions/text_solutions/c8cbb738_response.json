Identify the positions of colored cells within the input grid that are not 'Gray'.\n2. Notice how the colored cells are organized in smaller groups, creating patterns centered around the cells of interest.\n3. Extract a segment based on the positions of the central features in the grid.\n4. Form a new smaller grid that captures the essential pattern surrounding those key cells.\n\nThe pattern essentially seems to focus around the significant non-gray cells, excluding the rows and columns made entirely of gray cells and centering around key non-gray cells.", "solution_0": "Green|Gray|Magenta|White|Magenta|Gray|Green\nGray|Gray|Gray|Gray|Gray|Gray|Gray\nRed|Gray|Gray|Gray|Gray|Gray|Red\nWhite|Gray|Gray|Gray|Gray|Gray|White\nRed|Gray|Gray|Gray|Gray|Gray|Red\nGray|Gray|Gray|Gray|Gray|Gray|Gray\nGreen|Gray|Magenta|White|Magenta|Gray|Green\n"}
