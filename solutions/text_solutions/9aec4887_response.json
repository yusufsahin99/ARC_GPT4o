Specifically, the relevant parts in the transformations hint towards a segment in the middle section of the grid.\n2. **Create the new output grid concentrating on key elements such as distinct color rows and columns.**\n    - **First row:** Locate and extract the row containing unique colors like White and Blue.\n    - **Subsequent rows:** Look for significant and recurring colored elements like Red, Gray, Black, and Blue, preserving their arrangement while cropping excess elements.\n3. **Ensure continuity and similarity in structure** Compare observed patterns from previous examples to maintain a coherent structure, i.e., shifts of colors across columns but within smaller, cropped grids.\n\nThe output grid preserves and centered around the recurring and important color patterns from the input grid, ensuring continuity in colors and shapes in a truncated form.", "solution_0": "Black|White|White|White|White|White|Black\nRed|Gray|White|Black|White|Gray|Blue\nRed|Red|Black|White|Gray|Black|Blue\nRed|Black|Red|Gray|Blue|Blue|Blue\nRed|Black|Black|Green|Black|Black|Blue\nRed|Gray|Green|Black|Green|Gray|Blue\nBlack|Green|Green|Green|Green|Green|Black\n"}
