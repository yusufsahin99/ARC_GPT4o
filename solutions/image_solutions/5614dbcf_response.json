The primary colors in the center of these subgrids seem to play a significant role.\n\nTo predict the output grid for the test input grid, let's follow a similar extraction pattern:\n\nGiven test grid:\n```\nBlue   |Blue   |Blue   |Black |Black |Black |Black |Yellow|Black\nYellow |Blue   |Blue   |Black |Black |Black |Black |Black |Black\nBlue   |Blue   |Blue   |Black |Yellow|Black |Black |Black |Black\nBlack  |Black  |Black  |Green |Green |Green |Black |Yellow|Black\nBlack  |Black  |Black  |Green |Green |Green |Black |Black |Black\nBlack  |Black  |Black  |Green |Green |Green |Black |Black |Black\nBlack  |Black  |Yellow |Maroon|Maroon|Maroon|Black |Black |Black\nBlack  |Black  |Black  |Maroon|Yellow|Maroon|Black |Black |Black\nBlack  |Black  |Black  |Maroon|Maroon|Maroon|Black |Black |Black\n```\n\nFrom the training examples, the subgrids seem to be chosen mid-way through different sections marked by color change. Let's the same pattern:\nThe 3x3 output matrix is inferred as:\n1. Top-left subgrid around Blue\n2. Middle subgrid around Green\n3. Bottom subgrid around Maroon\n\nResulting in:\n```\nBlue|Black|Yellow\nBlack|Green|Black\nBlack|Maroon|Black\n```\n\nSo the predicted output grid for the test input grid in text format is:\n```\nBlue|Black|Yellow\nBlack|Green|Black\nBlack|Maroon|Black\n```", "solution_0": "Blue|Black|Black\nBlack|Green|Black\nBlack|Maroon|Black\n"}
