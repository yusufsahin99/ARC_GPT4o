The transformation rule observed is that the red cells propagate horizontally to adjacent cell positions. Here's how it applies to the new input grid:\n\n### Input Grid 0:\n```\nBlack   | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow | Black   | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow | Black\nYellow  | Yellow | Yellow | Black  | Yellow  | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow | Black  | Yellow\nBlack   | Black  | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow  | Yellow | Black  | Yellow | Black  | Black\nBlack   | Black  | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow  | Yellow | Black  | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow\nBlack   | Black  | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow  | Red    | Red    | Black  | Black  | Yellow\nYellow  | Yellow | Black  | Black  | Black   | Red    | Red    | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow\nBlack   | Black  | Yellow | Yellow | Black   | Red    | Red    | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow\nBlack   | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow  | Yellow | Yellow | Black  | Black  | Black\nYellow  | Yellow | Black  | Black  | Yellow  | Yellow | Yellow | Black  | Black  | Black\nYellow  | Black  | Yellow | Black  | Yellow  | Black  | Black  | Yellow | Black  | Black\n```\n\n### Transformation Steps:\n1. **Identify Red Cells:** The red cells are located at (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), and (6, 6).\n2. **Horizontal Spread:** Transform the grid by propagating these red cells horizontally to their adjacent positions.\n    - (4, 4) becomes Red\n    - (4, 5) remains Red\n    - (4, 6) remains Red\n    - (4, 7) becomes Red\n    - (5, 4) becomes Red\n    - (5, 5) remains Red\n    - (5, 6) remains Red\n    - (5, 7) becomes Red\n    - (6, 4) becomes Red\n    - (6, 5) remains Red\n    - (6, 6) remains Red\n    - (6, 7) becomes Red\n\n### Output Grid:\n```\nBlack   | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow | Black   | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow | Black\nYellow  | Yellow | Yellow | Black  | Yellow  | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow | Black  | Yellow\nBlack   | Black  | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow  | Yellow | Black  | Yellow | Black  | Black\nBlack   | Black  | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow  | Yellow | Black  | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow\nBlack   | Black  | Yellow | Yellow | Red     | Red    | Red    | Red    | Black  | Yellow\nYellow  | Yellow | Black  | Black  | Red     | Red    | Red    | Red    | Yellow | Yellow\nBlack   | Black  | Yellow | Yellow | Red     | Red    | Red    | Red    | Yellow | Yellow\nBlack   | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow | Yellow  | Yellow | Yellow | Black  | Black  | Black\nYellow  | Yellow | Black  | Black  | Yellow  | Yellow | Yellow | Black  | Black  | Black\nYellow  | Black  | Yellow | Black  | Yellow  | Black  | Black  | Yellow | Black  | Black\n```\n\nSo, the output grid should be as shown above.
