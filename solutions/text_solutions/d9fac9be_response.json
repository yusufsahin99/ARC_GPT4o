The resultant output is always encapsulated in the upper left-most cell.\n  \n2. **Common Theme:** The result color chosen seems to follow a central object or frequent color in the grid. However, in each case provided, it has been unique colors (Red, Gray, White, Gray) often associated with structural elements or boundaries in the grids.\n\n3. **Simplify:** For input grid 0, upon thoroughly analyzing, identify White is a dominant and centrally relevant color associated with significant sections in the grid. The White color in the given grid is planned around central cells.\n\nThus, like previous transformations:\n```plaintext\nOutput grid:\n                             \n                            White\n```", "solution_0": "Blue\n"}
